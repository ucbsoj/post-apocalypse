          <p>The term “apocalypse” has become something of a mediated buzz word, often characterized by zombie imagery and desolate cityscapes akin to those seen in TV Series, The Last of Us.  <p>

          <p>However, in a world where climate change, political uprise, epidemics, and global conflict have meant increasing uncertainty around the planet’s longevity, it’s time to re-imagine the word and the possibility that instead of a looming fate, “it has already happened”, say Jake Kosek and colleague Paul Fine, researchers at UC Berkeley.  <p>

          <p>“the Anthropocene being formally recognized as a moment in history means defining all of human impact over the past who-knows-how-long in a single statistic. Meanwhile, we already know what this impact is because everyone can feel it,”  said Kosek. <p>

          <p>Arguably, facing a similar fate is the term <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/17/climate/anthropocene-age-geology.html">“Anthropocene”</a> A word referring to a period of human impact on the physical environment. Researchers globally have been working for the past decade to ground the word in physical evidence of when the period started, and results from this search are expected by <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/anthropocene-site-competition-golden-spike">end of summer 2023</a> <p>

          <p>For those researching this topic, this is a big deal. <p>

          <p>But some are concerned that the conversation these findings start will set us on the wrong path for understanding the current state of the world. <p>

          <p>In his post-apocalyptic botany class spring of 2023, professor Jake Kosek scribbles a list of key terms on the chalkboard, “Anthropocene”, “Apocalypse”, “Post-Apocalypse”, “Nature”, “Human Race”, “Disaster”. Across the course of 4 short months, he would work with to unpack these terms and push his class to imagine themselves as living on a post-apocalyptic planet.  <p>
 
          <p>Kosek explains that the concept of the “Anthropocene” “feels like part of the problem. Because really, only certain people have created this disaster. The ‘we are all in this now’ mentality presents a ‘we’ that erases those who benefitted from and continue to benefit from the history of that violence.” <p>

          <p>In other words, the idea that the Anthropocene marks the human experience on the planet disregards the fact that many communities have significantly different experiences from one another. It secondhandedly glosses over important histories of colonization that have defined the experience and disadvantage of many marginalized groups.  <p>
